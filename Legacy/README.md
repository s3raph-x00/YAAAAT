# Why Is This Still Here #

##### Because it is still in pre-alpha, there are alot of bugs. This version of the Autopsy plugin was working before the 4.19.x release but was later broken due to code updates in the current verion(s). This is left here (unsupported) in case you still are required to use older Autopsy versions that can't support the current release. #####
