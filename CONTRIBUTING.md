## How to contribute to Ruby on Rails

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/s3raph-x00/YAAAAT/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/s3raph-x00/YAAAAT/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Is the issue caused by a third party binary (JADX, OpenSSL, etc.). If so create a new Issue in this repository so we can track the issue(s) and also create one with the associated binary's Github.
 
#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

However, feel free to add open an issue if something is egregious along with recommended changes.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a new issue detailing your proposed change/feature and start writing code.
